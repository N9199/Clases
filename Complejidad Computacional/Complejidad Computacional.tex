    Objective: Measure complexity of a problem.\\

    That is: We want to measure computational resources needed to solve a problem.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Time

        \item Space

        \item ...
    \end{itemize}

    But first, let us define a problem
    \begin{defn}[Alphabet $\Sigma$]
        A finite set of symbols
    \end{defn}
    \begin{ejm}
        \[\Sigma=\{0,1\}\]
    \end{ejm}
    \begin{defn}[Word $w$]
        A finite sequence of symbols from $\Sigma$
    \end{defn}
    \begin{defn}[$\Sigma^\star$]
        The set of all words over the alphabet $\Sigma$
    \end{defn}
    \begin{defn}[Language $L$]
        A set of words
    \end{defn}
    \begin{ejm}
        \[L=\{0^n1^n|n\in\set{N}\]
        \[L=\{p|p\text{ has integer roots}\]
    \end{ejm}
    Decision problem associated to a language $L$: Given $w\in\Sigma^\star$, decide if $w\in L$ (or $w\notin L$)\\

    The complexity of a language $L$ is the complexity of a decision problem associated to $L$\\

    When can we say that $L$ can be solved efficiently?\\

    How can we show that a problem is difficult?\\

    What is an algorithm?\\
    Turing machines: An intent to formalize this concept\\
    Is it possible to show that Turing machines capture the notion of an algorithm?\\
    No way. Algorithm is an intuitive concept.\\ %Really?
    Why do we believe that Turing machines are a good formalisation of the notion of an algorithm?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item All programs of a Turing machine can be implemented

        \item All known algorithms can be implemented on a Turing machine
        
        \item All other attempts to formalize the concept are reducible to Turing machines
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The best attempts are equivalent to Turing machines

            \item All "reasonable" formalisations are efficiently inter-reducible.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

    \section{Turing machines: The idea}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item An infinite tape to read from and write to

        \item A read/write head that can move along the tape

        \item Accept/Reject state to tell us if the word belongs to the language or not
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{obs}
        The machine can go forever
    \end{obs}

    \begin{defn}[Deterministic Turing machine]
        \[Q,\Sigma, \Gamma,\delta,q_0,q_{accept},q_{reject}\]
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $Q$ is a finite set of states

            \item $\Sigma$ is the input alphabet, where $\vdash,B\notin \Sigma$

            \item $\Gamma$ is the tape alphabet, where $\Sigma\cup\{\vdash,B\}\subset\Gamma$

            \item $q_0\in Q$ initial state

            \item $q_{accept}\in Q$ accepted state

            \item $q_{reject}\in Q$ rejected state

            \item $\delta$ transition function
        \end{itemize}
    \end{defn}
